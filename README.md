# Work Day Scheduler



The task was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery while using Day.js

I initially started working on it in the file that I use for class then had to copy everything over into a new file that is connected to github
